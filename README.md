Project Description
I have created a signup and signin system for user authentication. The application behaves as follows:

Signup and Signin:

Users can sign up by filling out a form on the signup page.
After successfully signing up, users are redirected to the login page.
Upon logging in, users are directed to the home screen.
Navigation and Roles:

The home screen features a side navigation bar.
Regular users see only four dummy menu items in the navigation bar.
SuperAdmins see all available options in the navigation bar.
Role Management:

SuperAdmins can access the Role Management page.
They can create, update, assign, and delete roles.
This allows for dynamic control over user permissions and accessible menus.
User Management:

The User Management page displays data for users who have signed up.
SuperAdmins can toggle a user's role between Admin and User.
This provides the flexibility to promote or demote users as needed.
Personal Experience
This project was an excellent learning experience, allowing me to implement and understand user authentication,
role-based access control, and dynamic UI updates. Although I had to attend to some personal tasks and couldn't 
continue further, the project provided substantial learning and development opportunities.
